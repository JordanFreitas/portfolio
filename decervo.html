                    <h1>Role: UI Designer, UX Designer, Mobile App Developer</h1>
                    <h1>deCervo is a New York, Colombia University based company focused on enhacing player cognitive performance.  My work and involvement with the company began in the Spring 2016.  From my extensive background in baseball, knowledge of code/engineering, and user experience I have been able to redesign and assist in iteration of their mobile application and have most recently designed, directed, and implemented deCervo's entire website overhaul.    
                    <br>
                    Due to the current size of the company, my days were spent quickly learning, constantly adapting, and tailoring my skills for the ultimate goal of the company.  Endless hours of self-teaching, debugging, and testing was core as I often was the sole designer/developer leading to many iterations of trial-and-error that comes with starting a company.
                    <br>
                    In addition to the hard skills(C#, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Prototyping, Wireframing, Developing, Device Testing etc.) and programs used(Unity, Adobe Products, Tableau, Axure etc.), my experience has offered countless soft skills including interviewing, hiring, directing, and managing developers, working in sprint development cycles, and overall communication and interaction in a business/high-level/fast-moving environment.  </h1>

were able to figure out what we wanted out of making this website, what features we want to showcase, and the overall feel we
wanted users to have when coming to this website.  A lot of this involved taking the company ideas and putting them down into a 
virtual form as well as using this website primarily as a marketing tool.</p>

useful for the user.  During this step we were able to fill in the gaps that were uncovered in the intial collection of 
ideas and themes for the website.</p>

changed, moved, added and worked upon constantly!!!  As seen below
the mockups contained every aspect the website needed, from logos, to informational sections, to slideshow functionality.
These were first done using illustrator(not a Mac user so no sketch...yet!), and later pushed into Axure which is a high-fidelity prototyping tool. </p>

design sense to take what I invisioned to code.  This brought my wireframes to life, adding styling, movements, slideshows and other
vital functionality that turned the simple frames to a complete website.  Consistent scheduling, check-ins, and code checking were vital for me to get the website how I envisioned.</p>
