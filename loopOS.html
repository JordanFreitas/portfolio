                    <h1>Sprint 1(Each sprint = 2 weeks)</h1>
                    <h1>Theme. Values. Surveys. Interviews.</h1>
                    <p>Quick successions of research, brainstorming, and collaboration were done to quickly fathom which focus points to build upon.</p>

                     <h1>Search, Analyze, and Compare possible design layouts for the website</h1>
                     <p>Here I took my companys' main ideas, their logos, their color schemes and mixed and match with differennt template
 styles and designs. This step showcased the design process and thinking of taking what works, is clean, and effective 
and pushing this in line with the goals of deCervo.</p>

                     <h1>Map User Experience Flow</h1>
                     <p>User Experience flow involved lots of talking, brainstorming, and drawing of the user experience side of the website.
The goal was to have fluidity throughout.  Have each step lead to the next logical step, each click lead to something
useful for the user.  During this step we were able to fill in the gaps that were uncovered in the intial collection of 
ideas and themes for the website.</p>

                     <h1>Wireframe using the design templates and flow created in previous steps</h1>                 
                     <p>Wireframing was by far the most complex part of this design process and implementation of the website.  These wireframes were
changed, moved, added and worked upon constantly!!!  As seen below
the mockups contained every aspect the website needed, from logos, to informational sections, to slideshow functionality.
These were first done using illustrator(not a Mac user so no sketch...yet!), and later pushed into Axure which is a high-fidelity prototyping tool. </p>
                     <img src="../img//website/HTML.png" alt="HTML Snip" class="decervoImg">
                     <h1>Create HTML template and framework</h1>   
                     <p>The main goal behind this step is to provide the developers a base template that they can work off of when implementing the site.
This puts together the frameworks, theme classes, and simple layout.  This helped expedite the process once handed off to the 
developers.</p>
                     <img src="../img//website/prototype.png" alt="Prototype" class="decervoImg">
                     <h1>Interview, hire, and direct web developers to assist in implementation</h1>   
                     <p>The first part of this was finding a web developers that both had the skills to implement my designs from the wireframes and the 
design sense to take what I invisioned to code.  This brought my wireframes to life, adding styling, movements, slideshows and other
vital functionality that turned the simple frames to a complete website.  Consistent scheduling, check-ins, and code checking were vital for me to get the website how I envisioned.</p>

                      <h1>Set up payment methods, subscription methods, and user blog sections</h1>  
                      <p>This was the most vigourous step of this process and we began to implement third party resources into our website to increase
functionality.  These included ways to include payment methods(stripe), ways to subscrive to email lists(mailchimp), and 
creating sections for blogs and similar discussion forums(wordpress as the base, with forum aspects).</p>
                     <img src="../img//website/mailchimp.png" alt="Mailchimp" class="decervoImg">   
                     <h1>Ensure full responsiveness of site and insert needed linkage</h1>
                     <p>This brought the website 
functionality to the user side.  This step is in charge of responsiveness of the site as a whole so that each part and section works well
on mobile as well as large desktop screens.  Links between each of the pages are made in response to the user flow.</p>
